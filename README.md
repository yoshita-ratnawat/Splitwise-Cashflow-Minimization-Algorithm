# Splitwise-Cashflow-Minimization-Algorithm

Designed an algorithm based on a greedy approach that helps minimize the cash flow among the number of people.
It first settles all the amounts for first-person and then moves towards the left (n-1) people.


## Skills Nurtured

- Heap & Graph.
- Splitwise algorithm to remove unnecessary edges(cash flow) of the graph.
